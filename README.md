* Day 3: operators and conditions: arithmetic, compound and comparision operators, conditions and combining conditions, operators, switch, ranges
* Day 4: loops: for, while and repeat loops, break and break for nested loops, continue, infinite loops
* Day 5: functions: write functions, parameters, return values, parameter labels, omit parameter labels, defalt parameters, variadic functions, write and run throwing functions, and inout parameters
* Day 6: closures part 1: write closures, accept parameters, return values, closures as parameters, trailing closure syntax 
* Day 7: closures part 2: closures as parameters when they accept parameters, closures as parameters when they return values, shorthand parameter names, closures with multiple parameters, returning closures from functions, capturing values
* Day 8: structs part 1: create structs, computed properties, property observers, methods, mutating methods, properties and methods of strings and arrays
* Day 9: structs part 2: initializers, referring to current instance, lazy properties, static properties and methods, access control
* Day 10: classes: create classes, class inheritance, overiding methods, final classes, copies of objects point to same piece of memory, deinitializers, mutability of properties
* Day 11: protocols and extensions: write protocols, protocol inheritance, extensions, protocol extensions, protocol-oriented programming
